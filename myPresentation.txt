My name is Eleonor SEMEVO. I was born at Issia at Ivory cost. But I am originally Beninese.
I studied software engineering. I'm actually working as a freelance software developer.
In order to upgrade my knowledge and network, I joined Stutern to go deeper into the software
engineering program.
I like cooking and having adventures.
